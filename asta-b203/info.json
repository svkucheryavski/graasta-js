Here we have a normally distributed population — concentration of Chloride in different parts of a water source. The concentration has a fixed mean, <em>µ</em> = 100 mg/L, and a standard deviation, <em>σ</em>, which you can vary from 1 to 5 mg/L. The population distribution is shown using gray colors on the left plot. Blue points on that plot show values of a current sample, randomly taken from the population. The vertical lines show the corresponding means.</p> <p>If we know mean of population, <em>µ</em>, and sample size, we can compute an interval of expected mean values of the future samples, <em>m</em>. So, when you take a new random sample of that size from the population, its mean value will likely to be inside the interval. This interval is called <em>confidence interval for mean</em>and since we compute it based on population parameter, it is <em>population based</em>.</p> <p>Right plot shows distribution of possible mean values of samples to be randomly taken from the current population (and for current sample size). Confidence interval, computed for 95% confidence level is shown as a gray area under the distribution curve. The blue vertical line on that plot is a mean of your current sample. Try to take many samples and see how often the mean of a sample will be inside the interval (table under the plot shows this information). If you repeat this many (hundreds) times, about 95% of the samples should have mean within the interval.</p>"
