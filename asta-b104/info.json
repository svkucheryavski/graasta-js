In this case the values (height of people, <em>x</em>) are indeed randomly taken from a population, where they follow normal distribution with mean = 170 cm and standard deviation = 10 cm. The values of the current sample are shown in the large table as row <em>x</em> and on the plot as y-axis values.</p> <p>First, for every value <em>x</em> we compute probability <em>p</em>, to get a value even smaller, similar to what we did when computed percentiles. In this case we use <code>p = (i - 0.5) / n</code>. But if sample size is smaller than 10, the formula is slightly different: <code>p = (i - 0.375) / (n + 0.25)</code>. For example, if sample size = 6, then the first value (i = 1) will have the following p: <code>p = (1 - 0.375) / (6 + 0.25) = 0.100</code>.</p> <p>After that, for every <em>p</em> we find corresponding standard score, <em>z</em>, using ICDF function for normal distribution. For example, if p = 0.100, the z-score can be found to be equal to -1.28. You can check it using app for PDF/CDF/ICDF or in R by running <code>qnorm(0.100)</code>. Finally we make a plot where sample values, <em>x</em> are shown as y-axis and the <em>z</em>-scores are shown as x-axis. In case if values follow normal distribution ideally they have linear dependence on z-scores, so the points will lie close to a straight line, shown as blue. The closer real points are to this line the more likely that they came from normally distributed population.</p>"
