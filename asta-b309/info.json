   "help": "<h2>Colinearity in MLR</h2><p>This app demonstrates how co-linearity can affect an MLR model. <em>Colinearity</em> is a situation when two or several predictors (<em>x</em>-variables) are correlated (have linear relationship). This can cause some problems when fitting an MLR model, as it implies the lack of correlation among the predictors. If correlation is above moderate, this leads to larger uncertainty between the estimated and expected regression coefficients. But If correlation is high/strong, this can lead to a very large uncertainty and makes the model uninterpretable. In some cases it can even make the fitting impossible.</p><p>The severity of the problem depends on several things. First of all, on how strong the correlation among the predictors is. Usually MLR is stable to weak or moderate correlations. Second factor is the sample size, the smaller number of observations the bigger the uncertainty is. And, finally, it also depends on the fitting error â€” how well y-values are fitted by the model. In this app you can change all these parameters and then take several samples and see how big will be the uncertainty and how far is the MLR plane from the expected. Start with default settings which gives the best model, take several samples and check how far the regression coefficients of the fitted model are from the expected/theoretical shown with gray bars. Then play with the sample quality parameters and check how do they influence the fitting quality.</p>"
