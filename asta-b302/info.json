   "help": "<h2>Correlation and population based confidence interval</h2> <p>This app helps you to understand the Pearson's correlation coefficient, <em>r(x,y)</em>, which is computed as covariance for standardized <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> values. Alternatively you can compute covariance for the original values and then standardize the covariance by dividing it to the standard deviation of  <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. If there is no noise at all, and <em>y</em> is linearly dependent on <em>x</em>, the correlation does not depend on slope of the line. However, when noise is present, the slope has an influence which you can see by playing with the app. The right column in the table with statistics (shown as gray) shows values for population, the middle column shows values for a current sample.</p> <p>The uncertainty for correlation coefficient of a sample depends both on the correlation of population and the sample size. The sample correlation coefficient does not follow any theoretical distribution, therefore for computing the uncertainty and corresponding confidence interval, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_transformation\">transformed statistic</a>, <em>z'</em>, is used. This statistic follows normal distribution if n > 10. The app shows how the distribution of <em>z'</em> looks like for different levels of noise and how it can be transformed back to distribution of <em>r</em> values.</p>"
