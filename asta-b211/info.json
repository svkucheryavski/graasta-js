   "help": "<h2>One way ANOVA</h2> <p>This app shows how one-way ANOVA tests means of three samples — the outcomes of a chemical reaction running using three different catalysis: <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>. We \"run\" the reaction with each catalyst 5 times, which gives 15 values — yield of each run in mg. The obtained yield values are shown in the top left table. The last row shows the average yield for each catalyst. You can adjust the expected effect for each catalyst and noise using slider controls.</p> <p>Then app computes a global mean for all original values and subtract it from the values thus creating a table with unbiased values, which are shown in the gray column. Table in the top of the column contains the unbiased values and their means. Under the table there are statistics: degrees of freedom (DoF), sum of squared values (SSQ) and variance or mean squares (MS = SSQ/DoF). Plot below shows boxplots for populations and points for the values.</p> <p>After that we split the unbiased values into a sum of <em>systematic</em> part, shown in the green column, and the <em>residuals</em>, shown in the red column. In the systematic part we assume there is no noise, so all outcomes for given factor level (e.g. column A) have the same value — the corresponding mean. Residuals are computed as a difference between the unbiased values and the systematic part. App computes DoF, SSQ and MS for each part and the F-value — which is a ratio of MS for systematic part and residuals. The F-value follows F-distribution shown under the original data table. We use this distribution to compute corresponding p-value and make decision about the H0.</p>"
