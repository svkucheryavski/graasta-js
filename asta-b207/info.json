   "help": "<h2>One-sample t-test</h2><p>This app helps to understand how does the one sample t-test work. Here we have a normally distributed population — concentration of Chloride in different parts of a water source. The null hypothesis in this case is made about the population mean, µ, and, depending on a tail, you have the following options — \"both\": H0: µ = 100 mg/L, \"left\": µ ≥ 100 mg/L, and \"right\": µ ≤ 100 mg/L. The population in this app has µ exactly equal to 100 mg/L, so all three hypothesis are true in this case. You have a possibility to change the standard deviation of the population, which by default is set to 3 mg/L but you will see, that it does not influence the outcome of the test.</p> <p>Then you can take a random sample from this population and see how far the mean of the sample is from the mean of the population. The app computes a chance to get a sample as extreme as given or even more extreme assuming that H0 is correct — the <strong>p-value</strong>. Usually p-value is used to assess how extreme your particular sample is for being taken from population where H0 is true. If p-value is small, it is considered as unlikely event and H0 is rejected.</p> <p>Often researchers use 5% (0.05) as a threshold for that. It is called <em>significance limit</em>. You will see that if you take many samples (100 or more), you will find out that approximately 5% of the samples will have p-value below 0.05 although the H0 is true. And this happens regardless the sample size. So this threshold is simply a chance to make a wrong decision by rejection the correct H0. So, if you use 0.05 you have 5% chance to make a wrong decision and e.g. \"see\" an effect, which does not exist.</p>"
