Some of them are red, some are blue. You can change the proportion of the red individuals as you want (by default it is 50%). The population is shown as large plot on the left.</p> <p>If we know proportion of population and sample size we can compute an interval of expected proportions of the future samples. So, when you take a new random sample of that size from the population, its proportion will likely to be inside the interval. This interval is called <em>confidence interval for proportion</em> and since we compute it based on proportion parameter, it is <em>population based</em>.</p> <p>The interval for selected population proportion and current sample size computed for 95% confidence level is shown as a red area under a distribution curve on the right. The vertical line on that plot is a proportion of your current sample. Try to take many samples and see how often the proportion of the sample will be inside the interval (text on the plot shows this information). If you repeat this many (hundreds) times, about 95% of the samples should have proportion within the interval. <strong>However this works only if number of individuals in each group is at least 5.</strong> So if proportion is 10% you need to have sample size n = 50 to meat this requirement.</p>"
