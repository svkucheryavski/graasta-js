   "help": "<h2>Power of test and Type II errors</h2> <p>This app is similar to <code>asta-b207</code> where you played with one-sample t-test. However, in this case you can emulate situations when H0 is not true, meaning the true population mean, µ is different from what you expect by setting H0. The possibilities for H0 are the same, depending on a tail, you have the following options — \"left\": µ ≥ 100 mg/L, and \"right\": µ ≤ 100 mg/L. But now you can also change the real population mean and set it to be smaller or larger than 100 mg/L.</p> <p>Try to do this and check how often you will be able to reject H0 (in this case we work with significance level 0.05, so we reject H0 when p-value is below this value). A probability to reject wrong H0 is called a <strong>power of test</strong>. And the situation when you can not reject it is called <strong>Type II</strong> error or false negative. The probability to get Type II error is always opposite to the power of test, e.g. if power is 80% you have 20% chance to make a Type II error.</p> <p>The power of any test depends on several things. First of all it is the test itself — different methods have different power. Second, it depends on the <strong>size of effect</strong> — difference between H0 mean and the real population mean (H1). E.g. if H0 assumes that µ ≤ 100 and the real µ = 105, this difference is 5. Finally, power also depends on standard deviation of your population as well as on the sample size. The last has very important consequence — the smaller effect you want to detect, the larger sample size should be.</p>"
