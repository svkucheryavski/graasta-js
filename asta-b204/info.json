Thus on the right plot you see distribution and 95% confidence interval computed for current sample. The population mean (which in real life is unknown) is shown as a vertical line.</p> <p>        Try to take many samples and see how often mean of the population will be inside confidence interval computed for the sample. If you repeat this many (hundreds) times, about 95% of the samples will have interval, which contains the population mean. So, before you take a new sample you have 95% chance that confidence interval, computed around the sample mean, will contain the population mean.</p> <p>In this case we use Student's t-distribution to compute the interval. For given confidence level (e.g. 95%) and for given sample size (e.g. 5) we define a critical t-value — how many standard errors the interval will span on each side of the sample mean. E.g. for n = 5 this value is 2.78. You can see this value for current sample size in the table with statistics. If you have R you can also compute this value using ICDF function for t-distribution: <code>qt(0.975, 4)</code>. Here 0.975 is the right boundary of 95% interval and 4 is a number of degrees of freedom, which in this case is equal to <nobr>n - 1</nobr>.</p>"
