   "help": "<h2>Test for sample proportion</h2><p>This app visualizes a test for proportion of a sample — how likely the current sample came from population with given H0. In this case H0 is true, our population indeed has a proportion, π, which we set manually in the app (the population is shown on the left plot). So we expect that the test will confirm the H0 most of the time.</p> <p>Every time you take a new sample, app computes standard error and makes sampling distribution of possible        proportions around π using the computed standard error and normal distribution. After that it evaluates how extreme your sample is and results in a p-value — chance to get a sample with proportion like you have or even more extreme assuming that H0 is true. If you take many samples, e.g. 200 or 300, then only 5% will have a p-value below 0.05, you can see all statistics right on the plot.</p> <p>However, this will work only if sample size is large enough. Try to set the population proportion to π = 0.05 or 0.95. You will see that in this case even sample with n = 40 is too small for the test — sampling distribution curve will be truncated on one side. This leads to two problems — you will see an extreme p-value more often than expected and you have a chance to get a sample with members only from one group, so the sample proportion will be either 0 or 1. In this case standard error is 0 and there is no possibility to make a test. You need much larger sample to make a reliable test for such cases.</p>"
