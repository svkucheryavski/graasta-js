   "help": "<h2>Two sample t-test</h2><p>This app shows how to compare means of two samples. In this case the objective is to find out if the samples were taken from populations with the same means (H0: µ1 = µ2) or not (H1: µ1 ≠ µ2). Here we use this test to see if increasing a temperature influence the yield of a chemical reaction. So, the population 1 consists of all possible outcomes of the reaction running at T = 120ºC. The population 2 consists of all possible outcomes of the reaction running at T = 160ºC. We assume that there are no other systematic factors involved so the variation of yield within each population is totally random and is distributed normally. The left plot shows the corresponding distributions using blue and red colors.</p> <p>By default µ1 = µ2 = 100 mg. Since µ1 – µ2 = 0, we can say that in this case <em>temperature does not have any effect on yield</em>. However, if we run the reactions just a few times (e.g. 3 for each temperature) you will always observe an effect and therefore you need to asses how likely you observe it just by chance.</p> <p>Use the app and investigate how often you will see an effect, which is not present and, vice versa, how often you will not be able to detect an existent effect. Check how the real (expected) effect size, noise and sample size influence this ability. The app works using significance level 0.05 but remember that for real applications it is better to use smaller value for the level.</p>"
