Each parameter has own distribution. Thus, <em>Age</em> is distributed uniformly, <em>IQ</em> is distributed normally and <em>Height</em> has distribution with two peaks (bimodal). You can also see how sample size influences the difference.</p>  <p>Plot series made for a population (histogram and boxplot on the left part and percentile plot on the right) are shown using gray colors. The size of the population is <em>N</em> = 50&nbsp;000. The plot series for current sample are shown in blue. A new sample is taken when you change any of the controls â€” select the population parameter or the sample size as well as when you force to take a new sample by clicking the specific button.</p>"
