   "help": "<h2>Multiple t-test and Bonferroni correction</h2> <p>This app shows how to compare three samples taken from three populations. The three populations are all outcomes (yield measured in mg/L) of a chemical process running with a catalyst A, catalyst B and catalyst C. Here H0: µA = µB = µC = 100 mg/L. This means that regardless which catalyst we use, the average yield of the reaction is 100 mg/L, so changing catalyst has no effect on the yield. But when we run the reaction only 5 times for each catalyst, like shown in the app, the mean of these 5 runs will not be the same as the expected mean of the populations. And most of the time you will observe a difference among the sample means. Our goal is to use a t-test to test the H0 and make decision.</p> <p>However, t-test can be applied for comparing mean of two samples, while here we have three. One of the possibility will be to run t-test three times — one for each pair. This is what is called a <em>multiple compare</em> — you compare samples using several tests to check a single hypothesis. But the more tests you do the higher chance that you will reject correct H0. Try to run the test many times and you will see that although app works at significance limit 0.05 (so we expect that the H0 will be incorrectly rejected in 5% of cases), the real percent of rejections will be higher, about 10%.</p><p>You can overcome this problem by using Bonferroni correction, which decreases the significance limit in each individual tests, so the overall significance will be 0.05 (or any other pre-defined value). You can see the effect of correction by turning it on in the app and repeating the sampling many times again. In this case the significance level for individual tests will be set to 0.05/3 ≈ 0.017 and the number of incorrectly rejected H0 will be around 5%.</p>"
