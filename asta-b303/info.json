So, you can see how confidence interval vary from one sample to another and how often the correlation coefficient of population (or it's trasformed value, z') will be inside the interval.</p> <p>Because the confidence intervals in this app are computed for 95% confidence level, you can expect that in 95% of all cases sample will contain the population parameter inside the interval. However, you will see exactly 95%, only if you take a large amount of samples, several hundreds or even thousands. This is similar to confidence intervals computed for other statistics, e.g. mean or proportion.</p>"
